# Processing tool for collecting site level data from various sources

A repository for the preprocessor of data to be used in SINDBAD MDI framework, and other research at the FLUXNET site scales


# Components:

The tool put together data from 3 main sources
- FLUXCOM data extractor that provides 
    - the fluxnet datasetsLaThuile2007 and FLUXNET2015 releases
    - remote sensing cutouts from fluxnet sites

- Site level extractions of biomass and forest ages from Simon. These include the FLUXNET BADM as well as the GlobBiomass satellite retrievals.
- Site level extraction of land and soil characteristics from FIDC that includes soil properties among others
- Land cover properties from HILDA+ and Hansen
- CLIFF downscaling of several global dataset to gapfill the tower measurements
